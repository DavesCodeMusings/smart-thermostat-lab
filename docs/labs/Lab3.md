# Designing a Simple Thermostat

_Work in progress_

In the previous lab, we learned how to measure temperature and humidity from the DHT11 sensor.

What does a thermostat do?
* Turn the heat on when the temperature of the room is cooler than the set temperature.
* Turn the heat off when the temperature is warmer than the set temperature.
