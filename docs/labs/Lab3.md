# Lab 3: Measuring Temperature and Humidity
To control the temperature of a room, we first need to measure the temperature of the room. In this lab, we'll attach a sensor, called the DHT11, to do just that. The DHT11 can also measure relative humidity, so we can include that informataion on the thermostat display without much extra effort or expense.
